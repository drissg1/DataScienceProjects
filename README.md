### Welcome to My DataScience Projects Page!

I am a recent Physics and Mathematics graduate from the Univeristy of Ohio State.  I am seeking a career in Data Science and Machine Learning.  This github is place to show some of the projects I am working on at the moment. Enjoy!

# List of Projects:
* Titanic Kaggle
  * I utilized a series of data cleaning techniques to prepare the titanic data set for a Random Forrest Classifier which was     implemented using SciKit Learn.
  * I achieve a kaggle score of 0.78947.
* Opioid Overdoses in CT
  * I am currently working an a project that utilizes data taken from the CT goverment page to run a k-means clustering           algorithim to try and find patterns in the victims. Which could lead to a more targeted preventitive care strategy. 
  * I am also using a ARIMA model to predict the number of deaths per month in the future.
